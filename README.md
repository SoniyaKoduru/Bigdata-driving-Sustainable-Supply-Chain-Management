# Introduction
As we all know bigdata is bringing revolutionary transformation in all the fields. Similarly in case of SSCM, it enables decision making, reduces environmental impact and enhances overall performance. But why SSCM . Because sustainability is no longer a strategy rather it has become mandatory. This paperd iscusses how BDA helps in decision making, revolutionizing supply chain traditional practices and key technologies , challenges and what is the future scope.

# Methodology
This study employs bibliometric research and content analysis to review over 30 articles on Big Data Analytics in sustainable and green supply chains, focusing on 10 significant publications from 2019 to 2023.

# Literature Review
Big data analytics drives sustainability by enhancing environmental practices, promoting green supply chain management, improving retail performance, fostering eco-friendly practices in the mining industry, and enhancing hospital environmental performance through AI integration.

# Technical Details
Apache Kafka and Flume for data collection, HDFS for storage, Apache Spark and Hive for preprocessing and analysis, machine learning and time series analysis for predictions, and Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib for visualization.

# Obstacles
Data Quality, Privacy and Security, Cost of implementation, Complexity, Limited Understanding and Ethical Concerns are the major obstacles involving bigdata analytics in sustainable supply chain management.

# Potential
A sustainable supply chain incorporates social, environmental, and economic factors at every stage of a product's lifecycle, from source to disposal. Big data has the potential to revolutionize sustainable supply chain management by enabling unprecedented insights, efficiencies, and environmental benefits across industries like predictive maintenance reducing downtime and improving machinery life, Inventory Optimization, Waste reduction, Route Optimization in Transportation for cutting fule & emissions and enhance employee technical competencies facilitating data driven culture.

# Recommendations
Implement automated governance frameworks such as Collibra or IBM InfoSphere for robust governance practices, and utilize encryption and access controls from AWS IAM or Azure AD for advanced data protection measures. Establish clear ethical guidelines and employ tools like OneTrust for compliance monitoring. Provide comprehensive online training through platforms like Coursera or Udemy for employee skill development. Lastly, invest in and stay updated with the latest technologies for advanced tools.

# Future Research
-Evaluating Cost Incurrence in utilizing bigdata tools and techniques for SSCM.
-Autonomous and decentralized supply chains may result in supply chain networks that are more robust and sustainable

# Conclusion
Overall Big Data Analytics (BDA) enhances Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) by promoting excellence, reducing risks, and fostering responsibility. Integrating AI and ML advances SSCM through automated decision-making. Exploring BDA's role in circular economy and decentralized supply chains is crucial. Organizations should enhance BDA capabilities through training and a data-driven culture. Despite potential costs, businesses must consider financial effects for resilient supply chains
